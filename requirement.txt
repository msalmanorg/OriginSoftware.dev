Blog:
    1-  https://www.creditninja.com/blog/what-is-tier-1-credit/ do I make the blog like this where it links to Supermoney and that is how I make 
        affiliate money but also generate leads to go to credit repair.

    2-  Can I link this to Google to make money on marketing and advertising from Google too?

    3-  I like the section about financial literacy. This can link to the course – www.trycreditworthy.com
    
    4-  Would love to also add financial calculators like that section on this site. This is good for generating traffic. https://thecreditlion.com/


Main Website:
    1-  https://crow4u.com/ - specifically like the section about latest news – can we link my blog similar to this to where it always shows the most recent articles published on the blog.
    I also like the FREE DIY Credit Repair Kit Section. Can we do something similar, but much cleaner and more attractive for free download for “10 ways to prepare your credit for homebuying” and/or “The Seven Deadly Sins of Credit Repair”. Then have this auto enroll them into our email list and make them a “lead” in Auto Fox. They would be the lead type “10 Ways Download – Lead” or “7 Sins Download – Lead” in Auto Fox. This would then trigger them to be added to the lead campaign

    2-  https://thecreditpros.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?appointmentType=category%3AScheduled%20Free%20Consultations – I like the option of scheduling in English or Spanish. I want to have those options available and I will use our calendly links, which I can provide.

    3-  https://tieronecredit.com/free-training/ Maybe add a free training section (can name is something else) and this is where we include links to Eventbrite events. Eventbrite provides widgets for this. Add widgets for Youtube and other social media here??

    4-  https://www.whitejacobs.com/our-mission/ - interesting page to consider

    5-  https://www.thecreditpeople.com/?channel=affiliate&afid=16763&crid=1&cpid=4404&segment=16763&ti=p16763&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=16763&utm_source_platform=16763&clickid=4288894 not a bad looking site, but still not as clean and sharp as I want.

    6-  https://www.creditversio.com/how-it-works I love how clean this website looks.
